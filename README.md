# Minimal PWA

Everything you need to get an app to be installable. This app does do anything besides that, no offline support, no notifications, no advanced caching, only a "Please install me" popup for Chrome and the option to install it via the dropdown in Safari & Chrome.

In order for this to work this directory needs to be served via localhost or https.

If you have any questions don't hesitate to open an issue.
